I talk about the eye

The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer layer of the eye that helps to focus incoming light. It plays a crucial role in refracting light and directing it onto the lens.

The retina is a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells. It converts light into electrical signals, which are then sent to the brain through the optic nerve, allowing us to perceive visual images.


Myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness, is a refractive error where distant objects appear blurry, while close objects can be seen clearly. It occurs when the eyeball is too long or the cornea is too curved, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it.

Cataract is a condition characterized by the clouding of the lens inside the eye, leading to blurred or hazy vision. It can cause problems with color perception, difficulty seeing at night, and overall reduced visual clarity.


Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, usually due to increased pressure within the eye. It can lead to gradual vision loss, starting with peripheral vision and potentially progressing to total blindness if left untreated.

The eye perceives color through specialized cells called cones, located in the retina. These cones are sensitive to different wavelengths of light and send signals to the brain, which interprets them as different colors.


Astigmatism is a common refractive error caused by an irregularly shaped cornea or lens. It leads to distorted or blurred vision at all distances due to the inability to focus light evenly on the retina.


The pupil is the black circular opening in the center of the iris. It adjusts its size in response to changes in lighting conditions. In bright light, the pupil constricts (becomes smaller), and in dim light, it dilates (becomes larger) to control the amount of light entering the eye.


Some common eye diseases in older adults include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. Regular eye exams are important for early detection and treatment of these conditions.


To protect your eyes from digital eye strain, also known as computer vision syndrome, you can follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away. Additionally, adjusting the screen's brightness, using proper lighting, and taking regular breaks can help alleviate eye strain.
